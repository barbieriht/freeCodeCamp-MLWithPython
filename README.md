## Projects Included

1. Project 1: *Rock Paper Scissors*
   - Description: For this challenge, you will create a program to play Rock, Paper, Scissors. A program that picks at random will usually win 50% of the time. To pass this challenge your program must play matches against four different bots, winning at least 60% of the games in each match.

2. Project 2: *Cat and Dog Image Classifier*
   - Description: For this challenge, you will complete the code to classify images of dogs and cats. You will use TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras to create a convolutional neural network that correctly classifies images of cats and dogs at least 63% of the time. (Extra credit if you get it to 70% accuracy!).

3. Project 3: *Book Recommendation Engine using KNN*
   - Description: In this challenge, you will create a book recommendation algorithm using K-Nearest Neighbors.
   
## Getting Started
